The app starts with a Get Started page, followed by user authentication using Firebase.

The wave patterns in the background are made using CustomPainter.

The main screen consists of a App Bar that shows a Menu icon and a Cart Icon, a Bottom Navigation for Home and Orders.

Home consists of different categories of products and Orders consists of a List of history of orders.

The two switch between each other using PageView.

Once you tap on a Category, you are offered with a GridView of Products for that Category.

Once you tap on that, you are taken to the ProductDetail screen.

You can see the product description in the form of a full screen Dialog.

You are given an option to add the product to Cart or Buy Now.
